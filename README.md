01 - **objective**:

*lovelymap* ðŸ’œ is a simple, lightweight JavaScript map for visualising geospatial data sourced from an SQL RDBS. It can be used on mobile or desktop broswer either as standalone web page or embedded within an existing site.

02 - **minimum required functionality**:
* option to publish privately for internal use **and** publically for external consumption
* built on open source technology where possible
* ability to read and visualise tables from PostgreSQL (without using GeoServer)
* ability to apply simple styling to map layers
* ability to render WMS/WMTS basemaps
* credentials to be inaccessible to end user
* compatible with EPSG:27700 and/or EPSG:3857 projections

03 - **suggested technologies & structure**:
* html + JavaScript + (css if required)
* Flask or Django for web framework? Do we need this at all?
* OpenLayers or Leaflet for JavaScript mapping library (using CDN to keep overall package as light as possible)
* PostgreSQL tables as data source (localhost for testing)
* map layers rendered as GeoJson? WKTs? Tiled WMS?
* for simplicity, bypass use of GeoServer for serving PostgreSQL layers
* hosting on Heroku? Azure? build locally for now? Do we even need to host lovelymap anywhere if it's running on the client (browser)?

04 - **development plan**
* Theo to get simple OpenLayers and/or Leaflet map up and running in required projections
* Theo to create PostgreSQL tables ready for use within map
* Ben and Theo to discuss *minimum required functionality* and *suggested technologies & structure*
* Ben to guide Theo in right direction to complete *minimum functionality* section
* Ben to review app
